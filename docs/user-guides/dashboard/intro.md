# Dashboards Overview

The *Dashboard* tab is the main page of the Wallarm portal in the [EU](https://my.wallarm.com) or [US](https://us1.my.wallarm.com) cloud.

After logging in to the Wallarm portal, you will be presented with a few dashboards that show the current status of the protected resources and provide some historical insights into the system events.

The available dashboards are:
*   “WAF”
*   “Scanner”

All dashboards are placed on a single scrollable page, one after the other.


##  The “WAF” Dashboard

This dashboard provides you with information related to the web firewall operations:
*   traffic statistics
*   data about applications under attack
*   blacklisted IP addresses
