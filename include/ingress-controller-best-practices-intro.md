    Wallarm’s version of Kubernetes Ingress controller is based on the [community-supported NGINX Ingress controller for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx), so the majority of recommendations found in the official Ingress controller documentation and in the public Internet are also applicable to the Wallarm’s Ingress controller.
